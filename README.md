# movies-recommeder-system

The Movie Recommender System is a Python project built using Streamlit, pandas, and the TMDB API. It leverages collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user-selected preferences. The system utilizes precomputed similarity scores between movies, stored in pickled files, to efficiently generate recommendations.

Upon selecting a movie from a dropdown menu and clicking the "Recommend" button, the system displays the top 5 recommended movies along with their posters fetched from the TMDB API. Users can visualize and explore these recommendations in an interactive web interface.

This project demonstrates the integration of various technologies to create a user-friendly and efficient movie recommendation tool. It showcases the practical application of data processing, API integration, and interactive web development skills. By providing clear documentation and code comments, this project serves as a valuable resource for developers interested in building similar recommendation systems or learning about Streamlit and collaborative filtering techniques.
